3-COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
----------
Usage: ./frontEnd [filename]


4-CODE COMPILATION:
---------
In my computer I am able to run the make file an execute with ./P1
example:
>make
>./frontEnd [filename.txt]

5-DESIGN DECISIONS & ISSUES
---------
Design Decisions:
runningout of time
Major Issues:
have code for recursive function calls to build ASM language, and basic output is done.
Havnig issues with <T> and getting recursive calls after T() to behave correctly.


minor Issues:
f_temp in main.cpp needs to concatinate argv[1] with .asm for criteria
